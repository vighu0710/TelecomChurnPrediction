## General Information
- In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. 
- In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate.
- Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.
- For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. 
- To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.
